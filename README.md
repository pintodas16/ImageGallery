# ImageGallery- [Live Url](https://pd-imagegallery.netlify.app/)

Here I build an ImageGallery app using React basic concept like -Component,hook-useState(),useRef(), propdrilling,custom style based on state and many more.

## key feature

<ul>
<li>Responsive Grid layout using tailwind css </li>
<li>User can set featured Image </li>
<li>User can Delete multiple Image at a time </li>
<li>User can drag Image one place to another place- I implement this feature with the help of useRef() hook and of course without any library .
        
</li>

</ul>
